REGARDING MODPACKS:
You may include my mod in a modpack, but must do all of the following BEFORE including it:
- 1. Send me a message, telling me you are doing so
- 2. Await my reply, which will have a license key
- 3. Wherever your public mod credit list is, put my name, a link to the mod, and that license key

If you are distributing via Feed the Beast's private launcher, you don't need the key but DO need to message me.
You must have FULL permission for all the mods in your modpack, especially if you're distributing publicly.

You may not make any money off my mod, unless you've discussed with me first. This includes things like adfly.
General server donations are acceptible so long as you're running multiple mods (not just mine).
Note: None of my mods are allowed in the Technic launcher, ever. If you want to know why, feel free to ask, but I wont allow it; use Feed the Beast instead.
